**Synopsis**

This project turns Pimoroni's Explorer HAT into a kind of Akai MPC, so we can use 16 touch pads.

It is a modificaton of the original drums.py program by Pimoroni.

You can add your own drum kits and play 16 different sounds.

MPCPi has been created by Iker Garc√≠a.

**Motivation**

Music used to be one of my main hobbies and I had always wanted a MPC. Finally I bought some turntables because they were more useful for me than a MPC.Once I bought the Explorer HAT from Pimoroni I thought I could make something similar to a MPC, at least the touch pads. Pimoroni crew had already something like that in their examples, drums.py program. This MPCPi can be considered a modification of that original program.

**Contributors**

Everyone can contribute to this project, improving the code or adding new sounds, functions... We can even make a complete MPC!
